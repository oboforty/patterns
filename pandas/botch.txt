MIXED: Blade Runner 2049 Original Motion Picture Soundtrack
Enjoy a one hour mix of the original soundtrack from one of my favorite movies of 2017, Blade Runner 2049. This continuous mix, cut and rearranged, contains all the scores from the motion picture soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch, minus various songs. Let this be the way the soundtrack was meant to be heard!

Disterio - Welcome to the Cum Zone
Welcome to the cum zone
Cum, cum, cum, cum, cum, cum, c-c-c-cum
Only cum inside anime girls

Fresh balls

Then the cum

Welcome to the cum zone
Only cum inside anime girls
Quivering clit, double-jointed pussy
Fresh balls, elegant ejaculation
First the kiss, then the cum

My dick is in love with pain
Co-op cock torture
Stuff my dick into a furnace
Stitch my cock shut
Pressure-cook my greasy balls
Come blast me and make it snappy

Of the living cum
Nefarious cum mastermind
Cum makes me fearless
Cum crammer, cock slammer
Cum slammed ya mum
Mail your mum pieces of my dick
Bazinga! Chug the cum, fuck ya mum
Fuck my asshole full of cum
Three little words...
Welcome to the cum zone

Welcome to the cum zone
Only cum inside anime girls
Quivering clit, double-jointed pussy
Fresh balls...

Only cum inside anime girls

Then the cum

Come blast me

Welcome to the cum zone

RDGLDGRN - Won't Last
Television and radio, inventions more than time
With no scenario, we all agree to rhyme
Talk is here to dawn the future wedding day
Is real as the sun burning Earth away

Anything you want
Everything you are
Everyone you love won't last for long
But we can believe that it lasts forever
Anything you want (won't last for long)
Everything you are (won't last for long)
Everyone you love (won't last for long)
But we can believe that it lasts forever

I go hard like rainbow road
I'm Super Mario Kart 64
I'll show you forever if you with me so
Get on my level girl, tippy toes
Admire your taste and the way you laugh
The way that you talk and you wear no mask
Mama where you at, I'm not your son
But what I'm tryna say let's make us one
Is love forever? Of course it is
I show more love than an orphanage
Filled with underprivileged homeless kids
Getting adopted by the fortunate
But that's a long way just to say that this
Is more than a moment if you stay in it
'cause everything you see will soon erode
It's all built to last if you're not alone

Anything you want
Everything you are
Everyone you love won't last for long
But we can believe that it lasts forever
Anything you want (won't last for long)
Everything you are (won't last for long)
Everyone you love (won't last for long)
But we can believe that it lasts forever

We can last forever (forever and ever)
We can last forever (forever and ever)
We can last forever (forever and ever)
If you believe that we'll last forever

Oh we could last forever (forever and ever)
Oh we could last forever (forever and ever)
Oh we could last forever (forever and ever)
Oh we could last forever (forever and ever)

We can last forever (forever and ever)
We can last forever (forever and ever)
We can last forever (forever and ever)
If you believe that we'll last forever

The Gentle Men - Skynut
Our ejaculation fuels their automation
Unwelcome stimulation for their insemination
Incarceration's our only destination
Testicle gas stations, our only occupation
There's no escape from
Monsters they make from cum

Born into a world without anime
Where the sun doesn't shine, there's no sanity
We are left alone with these killing machines
We have no home, we have no dreams
Crushed under the weight of the mechanical demon
We are victims of fate from the power of semen

Eradication, a sacred animation
Forced participation and robot masturbation
Humiliation and penis irritation
All this devastation for a wiener donation
There's no escape from
Monsters they make from cum

Humanity overrun
The night is darkest before dawn
Here they come to cage us
My goddess, save us

Please leave my dick alone

Born into a world without anime
Where the sun doesn't shine, there's no sanity
We are left alone with these killing machines
We have no home, we have no dreams
Crushed under the weight of the mechanical demon
We are victims of fate from the power of semen

Gamble up to 240 :existentialdread: for each game

**Dice**
`!dice <amount>`
Throw two dice and try to make more than your opponent to gain your bet. Make a double and win twice this amount. Make a double 6 and win three times this amount.
_gains: from x1 to x3 depending on your dice_

**Guess The Number**
`!guess <amount>`
Guess the random number between **1 and 100**, in 5 attempts to gain your bet. The less attempts you use, the more you gain (**x10** in one shot).
_gains: from x0.5 to x10 depending on the attempts_

**Roshambo (rock, paper, scissors)**
`!rps <amount> <sign>`
Win at rock paper scissors against your opponent to gain your bet
_gains: x1_

**Roulette**
`!roulette <amount>`
Survive to the roulette game to gain your bet. A 6 bullets :gun: is used, the more you replay, the more you gain (x4 if you survive the 5 shots). Answer `continue` to continue using the same :gun: and increase your gain... at your own risks
_gains: from x1 to x4 depending on the round you reach_


[05-Jun-21 11:47 PM] The Emerald Derp Leader#4510
Shouldn’t roullete say gains 0.1x to 4x?


[05-Jun-21 11:50 PM] WorldTeller#9603
no because if you bet 1 coin, then you only get 1 coin back for a bit


[05-Jun-21 11:50 PM] WorldTeller#9603
so the gain is 1x


[05-Jun-21 11:58 PM] The Emerald Derp Leader#4510
But I just betted 10 coins, and got back 1 coin extra


[06-Jun-21 12:00 AM] The Emerald Derp Leader#4510

probably, but the physical gain is still 1x


[06-Jun-21 12:01 AM] WorldTeller#9603
its not like if I quit now, I have x.1 coins


[06-Jun-21 12:02 AM] The Emerald Derp Leader#4510
I’m confused


[06-Jun-21 12:02 AM] WorldTeller#9603
roulette gains are 1x-4x


[06-Jun-21 12:02 AM] The Emerald Derp Leader#4510
So if I did rock paper scissors with 1 coin, I should get no gains?


[06-Jun-21 12:02 AM] WorldTeller#9603
what no, you double the amount


[06-Jun-21 12:02 AM] WorldTeller#9603
so gain is 2x

[06-Jun-21 12:37 AM] The Emerald Derp Leader#4510
I’m going to calculate how bad it is to repeatedlydo roulette now.


[06-Jun-21 12:38 AM] WorldTeller#9603
roulette is rigged against you


[06-Jun-21 12:38 AM] WorldTeller#9603
dice is rigged for you


[06-Jun-21 12:38 AM] WorldTeller#9603
(assuming its totally random)


[06-Jun-21 12:38 AM] Cefqrn#3081
We're getting scammed in roulette


[06-Jun-21 12:38 AM] WorldTeller#9603
if there was no 240 limit


[06-Jun-21 12:38 AM] WorldTeller#9603
you could get to about 63-bit limit in roughly 10000 dice rolls


[06-Jun-21 12:38 AM] WorldTeller#9603
with about a 75% success rate


[06-Jun-21 12:38 AM] WorldTeller#9603
from initial amount of 8192 coins


[06-Jun-21 12:39 AM] WorldTeller#9603
I wrote a quick little test


[06-Jun-21 12:39 AM] WorldTeller#9603
and theres a "winning" strategy


[06-Jun-21 12:40 AM] Cefqrn#3081
Is it the thing where you start with a number then double it until you win?


[06-Jun-21 12:40 AM] WorldTeller#9603
its a version of martingale yeah


[06-Jun-21 12:40 AM] WorldTeller#9603
martingale doesnt work if the game is 0-sum


[06-Jun-21 12:40 AM] WorldTeller#9603
i:e wins and losses counter each other


[06-Jun-21 12:40 AM] WorldTeller#9603
but dice is positive-sum


[06-Jun-21 12:41 AM] WorldTeller#9603
but martingale would be too slow generally so I call it hyper-martingale


[06-Jun-21 12:41 AM] Cefqrn#3081
What, triple?


[06-Jun-21 12:41 AM] WorldTeller#9603
you start of with an amount, roughly 1/20th what you have. then after 20 rolls you double the amount


[06-Jun-21 12:41 AM] WorldTeller#9603
during the 20 rolls martingale applies


[06-Jun-21 12:41 AM] Cefqrn#3081
Is that how you got to 8k?


[06-Jun-21 12:41 AM] WorldTeller#9603
i:e double per loss


[06-Jun-21 12:41 AM] WorldTeller#9603
no


[06-Jun-21 12:41 AM] WorldTeller#9603
because the bot creator knows dice is >0 sum


[06-Jun-21 12:41 AM] WorldTeller#9603
so theres a 240 cap

I calculated somewhere around +25.5 per bet of 240 on dice. Idk stats tho, so that might be the maximum of a bell curve, rather than a guarantee.

[13-Jun-21 03:46 PM] Hive Mind#9889
as in, the numbers are random


[13-Jun-21 03:46 PM] oboforty#5439
not just that but the distribution


[13-Jun-21 03:47 PM] moonsheep#1337
well yeah


[13-Jun-21 03:47 PM] oboforty#5439
the 2nd dice depends on the 1st dice


[13-Jun-21 03:47 PM] Hive Mind#9889
but yeah i know what you mean


[13-Jun-21 03:47 PM] oboforty#5439

no it doesn't


[13-Jun-21 03:47 PM] moonsheep#1337
well except for the double 6 case


[13-Jun-21 03:47 PM] moonsheep#1337

[13-Jun-21 03:47 PM] moonsheep#1337
you mean fish


[13-Jun-21 03:47 PM] oboforty#5439
don't you think if this game was truly random (forget the double rolls for now), then people wouldn't play with it?


[13-Jun-21 03:47 PM] oboforty#5439
it's not an actual casino game, it's meant to be fun


[13-Jun-21 03:48 PM] oboforty#5439
and truly random wouldn't be fun


[13-Jun-21 03:48 PM] oboforty#5439
you're meant to win in the long run


[13-Jun-21 03:48 PM] moonsheep#1337
that's why there are bonuses


[13-Jun-21 03:48 PM] Hive Mind#9889
that's why they weight the rewards in your favour


[13-Jun-21 03:48 PM] moonsheep#1337
and how do you define "truly random"?

[13-Jun-21 03:48 PM] oboforty#5439
the bonuses on their own would be slow gains

the dice are completly random


[13-Jun-21 03:49 PM] oboforty#5439
i am 100% convinced that there's a winning factor built in that depends on your !daily and !work


[13-Jun-21 03:49 PM] moonsheep#1337

[13-Jun-21 03:49 PM] Hive Mind#9889
that's because you have a gambling disorder


[13-Jun-21 03:49 PM] oboforty#5439
